# Questions regarding EMF
1. When we do something like y.quant > avg(x.quant), what should happen if the avg_1_quant in mf_struct doesn't have a value, because of the predicate defined for x, it doesn't intersect with Y (are we supposed to take default values like 0 or -1 ?)
2. The values were not matching with Q2 from paper-2 if we follow the 2 loops thing.
