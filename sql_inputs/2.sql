-- One may want to identify those months of 1997 that
-- were “significant” for the sales of a product: “For each
-- product and sales of 1997, show the product’s average
-- sale before and after each month of 1997.” (trends)

-- SQL
create view B1 as
select x.prod, x.month, avg(y.quant) as xx
from Sales x,
     Sales y
where x.prod = y.prod
  and x.month > y.month
group by x.prod, x.month;

create view B2 as
select x.prod, x.month, avg(y.quant) as yy
from Sales x,
     Sales y
where x.prod = y.prod
  and x.month < y.month
group by x.prod, x.month;

select B1.prod, B1.month, xx, yy
from B1,
     B2
where B1.prod = B2.prod
  and B1.month = B2.month;

-- ESQL
select prod,
       month,
